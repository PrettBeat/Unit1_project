          In order to keep reinventing themselves, and keep their enormous fan-base, Pokémon devs began to utilize ideas from other popular games. Little did they know, this was a slippery slope. They became so absorbed with adopting other games' ideas into theirs, that Pokémon began to look nothing like itself. They continued to plummet down the slope that is unoriginality, until finally, they hit bottom. Pokémon was a shell of it's former self. It still had all the lovable animals we had come to know and love, but not a single original gameplay element could be found. All we're left with now, is <span>Pokémon Plagiarism</span>.
