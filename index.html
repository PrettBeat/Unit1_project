          In order to keep reinventing themselves, and keep their enormous fan-base, Pokémon devs began to utilize ideas from other popular games. Little did they know, this was a slippery slope. They became so absorbed with adopting other games' ideas into theirs, that Pokémon began to look nothing like itself.
